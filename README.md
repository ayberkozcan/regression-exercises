### Regression Exercises

This repository contains a collection of small regression projects. Each project focuses on the following steps:

* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing datasets for analysis.
* Feature Engineering: Creating new features and transforming the data for better model performance.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigating relationships and visualizing data to gain insights into the regression process.
* Modeling: Applying various regression algorithms to the data.
  
These projects aim to explore different aspects of regression, from feature engineering to detailed performance analysis with various regression techniques.
