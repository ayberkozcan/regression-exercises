# Regression Exercises

This repository contains a collection of small regression projects. Each project focuses on the following steps:

### Data Preprocessing
 * Cleaning and preparing datasets for analysis
 * Encoding categorical variables and preparing the data for modeling
 * Scaling or normalizing data when necessary to make it suitable for analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Analyzing relationships between variables and identifying correlations
* Using various visualization techniques to gain insights into the data

### Modeling
* Building models using algorithms such as Linear Regression
* Applying different regression algorithms and comparing their performance
    
These projects aim to explore different aspects of regression, from feature engineering to detailed performance analysis with various regression techniques.
